The high H• emission seen in the Stream may indicate that its gas is being ablated away on a 100-200 Myr timescale (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2007). Whether the Stream is shock-ionized and/or photo-ionized is still unknown, thus the current models may overestimate or underestimate the lifetime of the Stream. Constraining the possible age of the Stream will be vital in perfecting models of the Magellanic System’s history. Several theories have been put forth to explain the ionization of the Stream. Yagi et al. (2012) proposed a shock-cascade origin for the H• (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2007,Tepper-Garciaetal. 2015)sincetheseclumpslieat the leading edge of a downstream cloud. Another theory, which interpreted results from Madsen (2012), suggests that the Stream was photo-excited by a burst of Galactic Center (GC) activity (such as a Seyfert flare) ~2 Gyr ago Bland-Hawthorn et al. (2013). The suggested source of ionization is GC Lyman-continuum photons, and the ionized gas is now recombining and emitting H• . However, the emission observed which this theory is based on has the same vlsr as galactic emission, making it difficult to distinguish the Magellanic gas from the galactic gas. To really distinguish how the Stream is being excited, a full map of the region will have to be made. 3. HISTORY OF H• STUDIES IN THE LMC AND SMC The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are interacting dwarf irregular galaxies visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere. Due to their proximity, they present a unique opportunity to study galaxy-galaxy interactions, as well as investigate how satellite galaxy pairs interact with their host galaxy. H• surveys of the clouds have been completed by Winkler et al. (2015) (MCELS). However, these are primarily studies of H II regions and supernova remnants (Ambrocio-Cruz et al. (2016); Le Coarer et al. (1993); Takeuchi et al. (2016)). While these surveys pick up the densest regions emitting in H• which are important for the study of star formation and death, they do not detect the warm ionized medium, or WIM, of the galaxies. In the Milky Way, the WIM has a filling factor if ~30% Reynolds et al. (1973). Studies (Find which ones to site?) of H• emission in other galaxies has shown that 25 -60% of H• luminosity emitted from spiral galaxies comes from their WIM, not from their HII regions. Studies of the WIM outside of our own Milky Way have focused on edge on galaxies, and is referred to as DIG (diffuse ionized gas). In one study, diffuse emission was detected many scale heights above the disk plane Lee et al. (2016). 4. THE WISCONSIN H• MAPPER The WHAM facility was specifically designed to study faintopticalemissionlinesfromdiffusesources. H• emission is produced through a recombination of an electron with an ionized nucleus. The intensity of the line is dependent on the integrated electron density squared, also known as the Emission Measure(cite units). As a result, these lines are very weak and an instrument with high sensitivity is necessary to observe them. Talk about previous studies. Previous observations byWHAM is better. WHAM is sensitive down to 0.2 R, enabling us to map faint emission away from the core of the Magellanic Stream. WHAMiscomposedofadual-etalonFabry-Perotspectrometer with a 0.6 m siderostat. In WHAM’s normal spectralmode, it hasa 1 field ofviewanda12km/s spectralresolution. Thisproduces anaveragespectrumofeverything within the beam and not of individual sources such as stars. Typical H• lines observed by WHAM have a fwhm of 20 km/s or larger, making the spectral resolution idea. A 30 second exposure can ideally achieve a signal-to-noise of 20 for a 0.5~R line with a width of 20 km/s. If the beams are Nyquist-sampled, then we will be able to resolve the Stream at 0.5 kpc size scales assuming a distance to the Stream of 55 kpc at it’s closest point. With a spacial resolution of 16 pc at a distance of 55~kpc, WHAM imaging mode will provide the necessary spacial resolution to probe the structure of these H II regions at the closest point of the Stream. (Cite why this is possible. Kat’s paper said it’s in Osterbrock?). While we will not be able to fully resolve the details of the Stream along its entire length, we will be able to estimate the total ionized mass. Due to the sensitivity required for detecting of H• and the spatial scale of the Stream, a full survey using telescopes that can detect the H• emission would be extremely time intensive, and thus impractical. However, WHAM was specially designed for faint H• detections, and as a survey telescope, is able to scan the large region of the sky relatively quickly. With a complete Magellanic Stream map, we can hope toconstrain thetotalmassoftheStream, providingmore complete parameters for theorists who model the history and future of the Magellanic Clouds. Additionally, the theory that our Milky Way had a Seyfert burst in the recent history can be further analyzed by obtaining a complete ionization fraction of the region of the Stream suspected of being ionized by the burst. 5. WHAT WILL I DO? Iplanonmappingthe Magellanic StreamwithWHAM inH• andcombiningthenewmapwithpreviousobservations of the LMC, SMC, and Bridge. The map will cover, at minimum, the "core" of the Magellanic 0 to ••120 Magellanic longitude. Once the "core" of the Stream is mapped, the survey will extend out to ± 20 degrees in Magellanic latitude to investigate if the diffuse H• extends beyond the known HI components of the Stream. As seen in figure 3, the Stream covers a velocity range of -400± 15 km/s vlsr. To map out the Stream, we have to probe deeper in velocity space then WHAM’s velocity window of 200 kms. Multiple position space overlapping observations will need to be made to cover this velocity window. This technique was previously used in Barger et al. (2013) where the author used the same process to map the Bridge. In the standard survey mode, WHAM’s mapping mode has a grid of 1 pointings that do not over lap but have a central separation of 1. These pointings are often smoothed to produce a map. With the Stream, where we can expect structure to be faint, and will increase our signal to noise by Nyquist-sampling the Stream, with each beam overlapping its neighbor pointing by 0:5. The current WHAM filters cover the total velocity range of the Magellanic system in H• from 400 to -400km/s vlsr. Figure 4 shows the coverage region for WHAM’s current filters across the total velocity space. Stream’s vlsr changes with longitude as you move along the Stream. Much like the previously observed Bridge, theH• emissionthathasbeenobservedinthepilotstudy by Kat Barger has shown that the emission is kinematically distinct from the neutral emission (See Figure 4). Duetosomeregionshavingawiderrangeinvelocitythan is covered by our 200 km/s window, many regions will havetobeobservedovermultiplevelocitywindowstoensure that all possible H• emission is observed. Additionally, these velocity ranges are farther out then WHAM’s standard velocity space. As a result, new atmospheric templates will have to be made to be able to reduce data at these velocities. The Stream Survey has already been mapped out and planned for WHAM. The Stream has been divided into 348 blocks, each with ~40 pointings. Each pointing is a single exposure of either 30 or 60 seconds. A single block takes ~ 40 minutes to observe with 60 second exposures per pointing for the faintest directions. If each block were to be observed with the longest exposure, it would take ~240 hours to observe the entire Stream. Already, 59 blocks have been observed, which has covered roughly 40% of the central core of the Stream. The blocks that contain HI emission will be prioritized, and the blocks farthest from the Stream will be observed when possible. Currently, I am working on a program to optimize when eachblock should beobserved tomostefficientlymapthe Stream. The interface region of the Stream was observed by Kat Barger and analyzed by her student Mike Hernandez. These observations have already been reduced and mapped, as can be seen in Figure 5. In addition to the map of the Stream, Kat Barger and Alex Hill have made prior observation of the LMC and SMC which have yet to be analyzed thoroughly. With the two galaxies mapped with WHAM, combined with the new Stream observations and Kat Barger’s Bridge observations, we should be able to complete the first consistent map of the Magellanic system, with the with the Leading Arm observations to be made at a later date by Kat Barger’s graduate student. Once the maps have been completed, we can use measured H• emission to estimate the total ionized gas mass of the Magellanic System. We can calculate the mass of the ionized gas as MH+ = 1.4mHneD2WLH+, where Ω is the solid angle, D is the distance from the Sun, mH is mass of a hydrogen atom, and the factor of 1.4 accounts for helium. The integral of the square of the electron density over the path length of ionized gas is Figure 3. This figure shows the HI velocities from the LAB survey, with the velocities stacked by Magellanic longitude. The Stream has a clear velocity gradient as you go from the LMC to the end of the Stream. The red line across the figure shows where Magellanic velocities can be confused with Milky Way material. Figure4.Thisfigureshows thefilter coverage over velocityspace, as well as the transmission curve of each filter.

Due to the variability in D, the calculation of the mass of the Stream will have to be divided up into sections. However, we will still be able to obtain an upper and lower limit for the total mass of ionized gas in the Stream based on the estimated range of distances. 6. PLAN For the first part of my thesis, I will be completing the analysis of the Small Magellanic Cloud. I will be investigating the total ionization fraction of the SMC, analyzing the rotation of the ionized gas, and mapping how far the faint emission reaches beyond the neutral gas component of the system. Once complete, I will attempt to create an atmospheric template for the velocity space of the LMC to try and correct for the pair of oxygen emission lines contaminating the data. Once this has been corrected for, I can analyze the LMC the same way as I have the SMC, combining these two surveys with the Bridge survey to create a complete map of the core Magellanic system. While I am working with the LMC and SMC data, I will be observing the Stream with WHAM to complete the survey of the core of the stream, and then move on to the fainter directions away from the Stream. While observing the Stream I will be extending the existing atmospheric template so that it covers the entire velocity space of the Stream. The core region of the Stream will be finished by Fall of 2016, which will cover the ionized gas which traces the neutral component of the Stream. Once that is complete, I will begin mapping regions further out in latitude from the Stream to attempt to detect if the diffuse ionized gas extends farther out then the neutral gas. 6.1. Plan Summary • Summer 2016 Write SMC Paper.
