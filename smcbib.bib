	abstract = {The combination of dispersion measures of pulsars, distances from the model of Cordes \& Lazio ({\textbackslash}cite\{cordes+lazio02\}) and emission
measures from the WHAM survey enabled a statistical study of electron densities and filling factors of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in the Milky Way. The emission measures were corrected for absorption and contributions from beyond the pulsar distance. For a sample of 157 pulsars at {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater}5{\textdegree} and 60{\textdegree} {\textless} l {\textless} 360{\textdegree}, located
in mainly interarm regions within about 3 kpc from the Sun, we find that: (1) The average volume filling factor along the line of sight /line\{f\}v and the mean density in ionized clouds
/line\{n\}c are inversely correlated:
/line\{f\}v(/line\{n\}c ) = (0.0184{\textpm} 0.0011)
/line\{n\}c\{ -1.07{\textpm} 0.03\} for the ranges 0.03 {\textless} /line\{n\}c {\textless} 2 \{\vphantom{\}}cm-3 and 0.8 {\textgreater}
/line\{f\}v {\textgreater} 0.01. This relationship is very tight. The inverse correlation of /line\{f\}v and /line\{n\}c causes the well-known constancy of the average electron density along the line of sight. As /line\{f\}v(z) increases with distance from the Galactic plane {\textbar}z{\textbar}, the average size of the ionized clouds increases with {\textbar}z{\textbar}. (2) For {\textbar}z{\textbar} {\textless} 0.9 kpc the local density in clouds nc (z) and local filling factor f(z) are inversely correlated because the local electron density ne (z) = f(z)
nc (z) is constant. We suggest that f(z) reaches a maximum value of {\textgreater}0.3 near {\textbar}z{\textbar} = 0.9 kpc, whereas nc (z) continues to decrease to higher {\textbar}z{\textbar}, thus causing the observed flattening in the distribution of dispersion measures perpendicular to the Galactic plane above this height. (3) For {\textbar}z{\textbar} {\textless} 0.9 kpc the local distributions nc (z), f(z) and ne2(z) have the same scale height which is in the range 250 {\textless} h ? 500 pc. (4) The
average degree of ionization of the warm atomic gas /line\{I\}w (z) increases towards higher {\textbar}z{\textbar} similarly to /line\{f\}v (z). Towards {\textbar}z{\textbar} = 1 kpc, /line\{f\}v (z) = 0.24{\textpm} 0.05 and
/line\{I\}w (z) = 0.24{\textpm} 0.02. Near {\textbar}z{\textbar} = 1 kpc most of
the warm, atomic hydrogen is ionized.},

	abstract = {We present the first fully and uniformly sampled, spatially complete HI survey of the entire Magellanic System with high velocity resolution, performed with the Parkes Telescope. The final data-cubes have an rms noise of sigma {\textasciitilde} 0.05 K and an effective angular resolution of 16 arcmin. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are associated with huge gaseous features with a total HI mass of M(HI) = 4.87 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_sun [d/55 kpc]{\textasciicircum}2, if all HI gas is at the same distance of 55 kpc. Approximately two thirds of this HI gas is located close to the Magellanic Clouds (Magellanic Bridge and Interface Region), and 25\% of the HI gas is associated with the Magellanic Stream. The Leading Arm has a four times lower HI mass than the Magellanic Stream, corresponding to 6\% of the total HI mass of the gaseous features. We have analyzed the velocity field of the Magellanic Clouds and their neighborhood introducing a LMC-standard-of-rest frame. The HI in the Magellanic Bridge shows low velocities relative to the Magellanic Clouds suggesting an almost parallel motion, while the gas in the Interface Region has significantly higher relative velocities indicating that this gas is leaving the Magellanic Bridge building up a new section of the Magellanic Stream. The clouds in the Magellanic Stream and the Leading Arm show significant differences, both in the column density distribution and in the shapes of the line profiles. The HI gas in the Magellanic Stream is more smoothly distributed than the gas in the Leading Arm. These morphological differences can be explained if the Leading Arm is at considerably lower z-heights and embedded in a higher pressure ambient medium.},

of the sky south of $\delta$ = -25{\textdegree}. The angular resolution of the
combined material is HPBW {\textasciitilde} 0.6deg. The LSR velocity coverage spans the
interval -450 km s-1 to +400 km s-1, at a
resolution of 1.3 km s-1. The data were corrected for stray
radiation at the Institute for Radioastronomy of the University of Bonn,
refining the original correction applied to the LDS. The rms
brightness-temperature noise of the merged database is 0.07-0.09 K.
Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in the correction
for stray radiation are for most of the data below a level of 20-40 mK.
It would be necessary to construct a telescope with a main beam
efficiency of $\eta$MB ? 99\% to achieve the same accuracy.
The merged and refined material entering the LAB Survey of Galactic H i
is intended to be a general resource useful to a wide range of studies
of the physical and structural characteristices of the Galactic
interstellar environment. The LAB Survey is the most sensitive Milky Way
H i survey to date, with the most extensive coverage both spatially and
kinematically.},
