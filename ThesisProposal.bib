This differs markedly from the canonical picture in which the Clouds travel on a
quasi-periodic orbit about the MW (period of {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr). Without a
short-period orbit about the MW, the origin of the Magellanic Stream, a young (1-2 Gyr old) coherent stream of H I gas that trails the Clouds {\textasciitilde}150{\textdegree} across the sky, can no longer be attributed to stripping by MW tides and/or ram pressure stripping by MW halo gas. We propose an alternative formation mechanism in which material is removed by LMC tides acting on the SMC before the system is accreted by the MW. We demonstrate the feasibility and generality of this scenario using an N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation with cosmologically motivated initial conditions constrained by the observations. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the origin of the Magellanic Stream in a first infall scenario. This picture is generically applicable to any gas-rich dwarf galaxy pair infalling toward a massive host or interacting in isolation.},

	abstract = {We compare the properties of gas flows on both the near and far side of 
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk using Hubble Space Telescope UV
absorption-line observations toward an active galactic nucleus behind
(transverse) and a star within (down-the-barrel) the LMC disk at an
impact parameter of 3.2 \{kpc\}. We find that even in this relatively
quiescent region gas flows away from the disk at speeds up to \~{} 100
\{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1 in broad and symmetrical absorption in the low
and high ions. The symmetric absorption profiles combined with previous
surveys showing little evidence that the ejected gas returns to the LMC
and provide compelling evidence that the LMC drives a global,
large-scale outflow across its disk, which is the likely result of a
recent burst of star formation in the LMC. We find that the outflowing
gas is multiphase, ionized by both photoionization (Si ii and Si iii)
and collisional ionization (Si iv and C iv). We estimate a total mass
and outflow rate to be ? \{10\}7 \{M\}? and
? {\textbackslash}quad 0.4 \{M\}? \{\{yr\}\}-1. Since the
velocity of this large-scale outflow does not reach the LMC escape
velocity, the gas removal is likely aided by either ram-pressure
stripping with the Milky Way (MW) halo or tidal interactions with the
surrounding galaxies, implying that the environment of LMC-like or dwarf
galaxies plays an important role in their ultimate gas starvation.
Finally we reassess the mass and plausible origins of the high-velocity
complex toward the LMC given its newly determined distance that places
it in the lower MW halo and sky-coverage that shows it extends well
beyond the LMC disk.

	abstract = {We establish with certainty that the Magellanic Stream (MS) is some 40{\textdegree} longer than previously known and that the entire MS and Leading Arm system is thus at least 200{\textdegree} long. With the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), we conducted a {\textasciitilde}200 deg2, 21 cm survey at the tip of the MS to substantiate the continuity of the MS between the Hulsbosch \& Wakker data and the MS-like emission reported by Braun \&
Thilker. Our survey, in combination with the Arecibo survey by
Stanimirovi{\'c} et al., shows that the MS gas is continuous in this region and that the MS is at least {\textasciitilde}140{\textdegree} long. The MS tip is
composed of a multitude of forks and filaments. We identify a new filament on the eastern side of the MS that significantly deviates from the equator of the MS coordinate system for more than {\textasciitilde}45{\textdegree}.
Additionally, we find a previously unknown velocity inflection in the MS tip near MS longitude L MS ?-120{\textdegree} at which the
velocity reaches a minimum and then starts to increase. We find that five compact high-velocity clouds cataloged by de Heij et al. as well as Wright's Cloud are plausibly associated with the MS because they match the MS in position and velocity. The mass of the newly confirmed {\textasciitilde}40{\textdegree} extension of the MS tip is {\textasciitilde}2 {\texttimes} 107 M
sun (d/120 kpc)2 (including Wright's Cloud increases this by {\textasciitilde}50\%) and increases the total mass of the MS by {\textasciitilde}4\%. However, projected model distances of the MS at the tip are generally quite large and, if true, indicate that the mass of the extension might be as large as {\textasciitilde}108 M sun. From our combined map of the entire MS, we find that the total column density (integrated transverse to the MS) drops markedly along the MS and follows an exponential decline with L MS of N\_\{H I\} = 5.9 {\texttimes}
1021exp(L MS/19fdg3) cm-2. Under the assumption that the observed sinusoidal velocity pattern of the LMC filament of the MS is due to the origin of the MS from a rotating LMC, we estimate that the age of the {\textasciitilde}140{\textdegree} long MS is {\textasciitilde}2.5 Gyr. This
coincides with bursts of star formation in the Magellanic Clouds and a possible close encounter of these two galaxies with each other that could have triggered the formation of the MS. These newly observed characteristics of the MS offer additional constraints for MS
simulations. In the Appendix, we describe a previously little discussed problem with a standing wave pattern in GBT H I data and detail a method for removing it.},

centered on the SGP. Time-dependent models of Stream clouds exposed to a
flare in ionizing photon flux show that the ionized gas must recombine
and cool for a time interval To = 0.6 - 2.9 Myr for the
emitted H$\alpha$ surface brightness to drop to the observed level. A
nuclear starburst is ruled out by the low star formation rates across
the inner Galaxy, and the non-existence of starburst ionization cones in
external galaxies extending more than a few kiloparsecs. Sgr
Asstarf is a more likely candidate because it is two orders
of magnitude more efficient at converting gas to UV radiation. The
central black hole (M {\textbullet} ? 4 {\texttimes} 106 M
?) can supply the required ionizing luminosity with a
fraction of the Eddington accretion rate (fE {\textasciitilde} 0.03-0.3,
depending on uncertain factors, e.g., Stream distance) typical of
Seyfert galaxies. In support of nuclear activity, the H$\alpha$ emission
along the Stream has a polar angle dependence peaking close to the SGP.
Moreover, it is now generally accepted that the Stream over the SGP must
be farther than the Magellanic Clouds. At the lower halo gas densities,
shocks become too ineffective and are unlikely to give rise to a polar
angle dependence in the H$\alpha$ emission. Thus it is plausible that the
Stream H$\alpha$ emission arose from a "Seyfert flare" that was active
1-3 Myr ago, consistent with the cosmic ray lifetime in the Fermi
bubbles. Sgr Asstarf activity today is greatly suppressed
(70-80 dB) relative to the Seyfert outburst. The rapid change over a
huge dynamic range in ionizing luminosity argues for a compact UV source
with an extremely efficient (presumably magneto-hydrodynamic) "drip
line" onto the accretion disk.},

	abstract = {The Magellanic Stream is a 100deg{\texttimes}10deg filament of gas that lies within the Galactic halo and contains
{\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}108 Msolar of neutral hydrogen. In this paper we present data from the H I Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) in the first complete survey of the entire Magellanic Stream and its
surroundings. We also present a summary of the reprocessing techniques used to recover large-scale structure in the Stream. The substantial improvement in spatial resolution and angular coverage compared to previous surveys reveals a variety of prominent features, including bifurcation along the main Stream filament; dense, isolated clouds that follow the entire length of the Stream; head-tail structures; and a complex filamentary web at the head of the Stream where gas is being freshly stripped away from the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Bridge. Debris that appears to be of Magellanic origin extends out to 20{\textdegree} from the main Stream filaments. The Magellanic Stream has a velocity gradient of 700 km s-1 from the Clouds to the tail of the Stream, {\textasciitilde}390 km s-1 greater than that due to Galactic rotation alone, therefore implying a noncircular orbit. The dual filaments comprising the Stream are likely to be relics from gas stripped separately from the Magellanic Bridge and the SMC. This implies that (1) the Bridge is somewhat older than conventionally assumed; and (2) the Clouds have been bound together for at least one or two orbits. The transverse velocity gradient of the Stream also appears to support long-term binary motion of the Clouds. A significant number of the most elongated cataloged Stream clouds (containing {\textasciitilde}1\% of the Stream mass) have position angles aligned along the Stream. This suggests the presence of shearing motions within the Stream, arising from tidal forces or interaction with the tenuous Galactic halo. As previously noted, clouds within one region of the Stream, along the sight line to the less distant half (southern half on the sky) of the Sculptor Group, show anomalous properties. There are more clouds along this sight line than any other part of the Stream, and their velocity distribution significantly deviates from the gradient along the Stream. We argue that this deviation could be due to a combination of halo material, and not to distant Sculptor clouds, based on a spatial and kinematic comparison between the Sculptor Group galaxies and the anomalous clouds and the lack of cloud detection in the northern half of the group. This result has significant implications for the hypothesis that there might exist distant, massive high-velocity clouds within the Local Group. Cataloged clouds within the Magellanic Stream do not have a preferred scale size. Their mass spectrum f(MHI){\textasciitilde}M-2.0HI and column density spectrum f(NHI){\textasciitilde}N-2.8HI are steep compared with Ly$\alpha$ absorbers and galaxies, and similar to the anomalous clouds along the Sculptor Group sight line.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a deep H-alpha imaging survey of 51 irregular and amorphous galaxies with the objective of searching for large ionized gas structures outside of normal H II regions. In this sample 12\% of the galaxies contain at least one ionized supershell (radius greater than or equal 300 pc), 24\% contain supergiant ionized filaments which are not obviously connected with a particular star forming region, and 27\% contain one or more of these types of structures. For the most part, large ionized gas structures are found in galaxies that are engaging in intense star formation or that contain at least one unusually large concentration of massive stars. Thus, in most galaxies these structures are likely to have been produced by massive stars. However, there is a large range in the properties of the host galaxies, and not all galaxies that are actively forming stars or that contain luminous H II regions also contain supershells or giant filaments of ionized gas. As giant H II regions appear to be more common than large scale ionized features, we statistically find either that not all giant H II regions will produce supershells or giant filaments or that the extra-H II region structures have a shorter lifetime than the giant H II regions
themselves. Two galaxies are particularly noteworthy. DDO 75 is a small galaxy with a low level of star formation activity but which
nevertheless hosts several remarkably large ionized supershells. We cannot explain the origin and ionization of these structures. By contrast, DDO 50 has a neutral interstellar medium which contains numerous holes but which has no extraordinary ionized gas structures. The most likely explanations are either that the H I structures in DDO 50 are older than the lives of the massive stars that produced them or that the H I holes were formed by a process not directly associated with concentrations of massive stars. Only 2 out of 15 normal irregulars viewed at inclination angles greater than 60 deg, plus two galaxies that are clearly in an abnormal state, show evidence for structures that are or could be extending out of the disk of the galaxy. In three of these systems the filaments which are farthest from the disks are roughly parallel to the galactic planes, and therefore have the morphologies expected of stalled supershells. Thus, galactic disk breakouts or chimneys containing optically visible ionized gas cannot be a frequent phenomenon in irregular galaxies and, even when they do occur, we cannot assume that a galactic wind is also present.},

High-resolution echelle spectra for both galaxies
demonstrate that filaments kinematically resemble typical extra-H II region ionized gas and generally have low, if any, expansion velocities. These observations and the large sizes of supergiant ionized filaments complicate shock models. Supergiant filaments could be photoionized, perhaps by leakage of Lyman-continuum radiation from classical H II complexes. Some supergiant filaments may be large-scale photoionization fronts on the surfaces of cool interstellar clouds. Such features could preferentially exist in galaxies, such as irregulars, where the
interstellar medium is fairly transparent to Lyman-continuum radiation. Such a situation could also arise in systems in which the production of superbubbles has been high, leading to large regions of low H I density.},

dilute portions of O star H II regions in a multiple component
interstellar medium. To make this exploration, we calculated the H II
region structures for the known Galactic O stars and compared the
integral properties of the ensemble (dispersion and emission measures)
with the observational data.

Our model assumes a smooth intercloud (or more precisely extracloud)
medium whose density depends only on z, and a statistical distribution
of small, opaque clouds. The latter have line of sight mean free path
$\lambda$(?) between encounters and are assumed to attenuate the
radiation field much as dust grains do, with differential fractional
loss dr/$\lambda$ in path dr on all sight lines, rather than forming
distinctions between shadowed and unshadowed lines of sight.

With the simplified assumptions of our standard cloud model, good
quantitative agreement is found for the electron density as a function
of ? and the dispersion measures to pulsars at high and low
latitudes as well as quantitative agreement for summary measures such as
the mean vertical column density of electrons, the average H$\alpha$
surface brightness perpendicular to the Galactic plane, and its decrease
at high latitude.  The implications of our model to the diffuse
interstellar medium and to the distribution of Lyman continuum absorbers

diffuse ionized medium ('Reynolds layer'). This flux is sufficient to
explain the potoionization of this, although we have not constructed a
model for the observed H-alpha emission and pulsar dispersion measures
that is fully consistent with the absorption rate of Lyc in the H II
layer. Since our quiescent model does not account for the effects of
dynamic chimneys and superbubbles, which should enhance Lyc escape, we
conclude the O stars are the probable source of ionizing radiation for
the Reynolds layer. For a random distribution of OB associations

radiation through evolving superbubbles within a smoothly varying H I
distribution, we estimate the fraction of ionizing photons emitted by OB
associations that escapes the H I disk of our Galaxy into the halo and
intergalactic medium (IGM). We consider both coeval star formation and a
Gaussian star formation history with a time spread $\sigma$t=2
Myr. We consider both a uniform H I distribution and a two-phase
(cloud/intercloud) model, with a negligible filling factor of hot gas.
We find that the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap or
attenuate the ionizing flux, so that most of the escaping radiation
escapes shortly after the formation of the superbubble. Superbubbles of
large associations can blow out of the H I disk and form dynamic
chimneys, which allow the ionizing radiation to escape the H I disk
directly. However, blowout occurs when the ionizing photon luminosity
has dropped well below the association's maximum luminosity. For the
coeval star formation history, the total fraction of Lyman Continuum
photons that escape both sides of the disk in the solar vicinity is
esc{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.15+/-0.05. For the Gaussian star formation
history, esc{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.06+/-0.03, a value roughly a factor
of 2 lower than the results of Dove \& Shull, where superbubbles were
not considered. For a local production rate of ionizing photons
$\Psi$LyC=4.95x107 cm-2 s-1,
the flux escaping the disk is
$\Phi$LyC{\textasciitilde}(1.5-3.0)x106 cm-2
s-1 for coeval and Gaussian star formation, comparable to the
flux required to sustain the Reynolds layer. Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities exist early in the OB association's evolutionary stages,
possibly causing the shell to fragment and increasing
esc{\textgreater}. However, if a significant fraction of H I is
distributed in cold clouds with nH{\textasciitilde}30 cm-3,

	abstract = {Since its discovery in 1996, the source of the bright H-alpha emission (up to 750 mR) along the Magellanic Stream has remained a mystery. There is no evidence of ionising stars within the HI stream, and the extended hot halo is far too tenuous to drive strong shocks into the clouds. We now present a hydrodynamical model that explains the known properties of the H-alpha emission and provides new insights on the lifetime of the Stream clouds. The upstream clouds are gradually disrupted due to their interaction with the hot halo gas. The clouds that follow plough into gas ablated from the upstream clouds, leading to shock ionisation at the leading edges of the downstream clouds. Since the following clouds also experience ablation, and weaker H-alpha (100-200 mR) is quite extensive, a disruptive cascade must be operating along much of the Stream. In our model, the clouds are evolving on timescales of 100-200 Myr, such that the Stream must be replenished by the Magellanic Clouds at a fairly constant rate. The ablated material falls onto the Galaxy as a warm drizzle which suggests that diffuse ionized gas at 10**4 K may be an important constituent of galactic accretion. The observed HI emission provides a new constraint on the rate of disruption of the Stream and, consequently, the infall rate of metal-poor gas onto the Galaxy. When the ionized component of the Stream is fully accounted for, the rate of gas accretion is 0.4 Msun/yr, roughly twice the rate deduced from HI observations alone.},

M? [d/55 kpc]2) encircling the Galaxy at a distance d is arguably the most important tracer of what happens to gas accreting onto a disk galaxy. Recent observations reveal that the Stream{\textquoteright}s mass is in fact dominated (3:1) by its ionized component. Here we revisit the origin of the mysterious H$\alpha$ recombination
emission observed along much of its length that is overly bright (\~{}150-200 mR) for the known Galactic ultraviolet (UV)
background (?20-40 mR [d/55 kpc]-2). In an
earlier model, we proposed that a slow shock cascade was operating along the Stream due to its interaction with the extended Galactic hot corona. We find that for a smooth coronal density profile, this model can explain the bright H$\alpha$ emission if the coronal density satisfies 2 {\texttimes} 10-4 {\textless} (n/cm-3) {\textless} 4
{\texttimes} 10-4 at d = 55 kpc. But in view of updated
parameters for the Galactic halo and mounting evidence that most of the Stream must lie far beyond the Magellanic Clouds (d {\textgreater} 55 kpc), we revisit the shock cascade model in detail. At lower densities, the H i gas is broken down by the shock cascade but mostly mixes with the hot corona without significant recombination. At higher densities, the hot coronal mass (including the other baryonic components) exceeds the baryon budget of the Galaxy. If the H$\alpha$ emission arises from the
shock cascade, the upper limit on the smooth coronal density constrains the Stream{\textquoteright}s mean distance to ?75 kpc. If, as some models
indicate, the Stream is even further out, either the shock cascade is operating in a regime where the corona is substantially mass-loaded with recent gas debris, or an entirely different ionization mechanism is responsible.},

Previous studies have also assumed that the Milky Way can be adequately modeled as an isothermal sphere to large distances. Here we reexamine the orbital history of the Clouds using the new velocities and a $\Lambda$CDM-motivated MW model with virial mass
Mvir=1012 Msolar (e.g., Klypin and coworkers). We conclude that the LMC and SMC are either currently on their first passage about the MW or, if the MW can be accurately modeled by an isothermal sphere to distances {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}200 kpc (i.e.,
Mvir{\textgreater}2{\texttimes}1012 Msolar), that
their orbital period and apogalacticon distance must be a factor of 2 larger than previously estimated, increasing to 3 Gyr and 200 kpc, respectively. A first passage scenario is consistent with the fact that the LMC and SMC appear to be outliers when compared to other satellite galaxies of the MW: they are irregular in appearance and are moving faster. We discuss the implications of this orbital analysis for our understanding of the star formation history, the nature of the warp in the MW disk and the origin of the Magellanic Stream (MS), a band of H I gas trailing the LMC and SMC that extends {\textasciitilde}100{\textdegree} across the sky.
Specifically, as a consequence of the new orbital history of the Clouds, the origin of the MS may not be explainable by current tidal and ram pressure stripping models.},

between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC,
respectively) and our Milky Way (MW) in light of recent high-precision
proper motions from the Hubble Space Telescope. Given the updated
velocities, cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure formation
favour a scenario where the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are currently on
their first infall towards ourGalaxy. We illustrate here that the
observed irregular morphology and internal kinematics of the Magellanic
System (in gas and stars) are naturally explained by interactions
between the LMC and SMC, rather than gravitational interactions with the
MW. These conclusions provide further support that the MCs are
completing their first infall to our system. In particular, we
demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a band of H I gas trailing
behind the Clouds 150{\textdegree} across the sky, can be accounted for by the
action of LMC tides on the SMC before the system was accreted by the MW.
We further demonstrate that the off-centre, warped stellar bar of the
LMC, and its one-armed spiral can be naturally explained by a recent
direct collision with its lower mass companion, the SMC. Such structures
are key morphological characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to
as Magellanic Irregulars, the majority of which are not associated with
massive spiral galaxies. We infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions
are important drivers for the morphological evolution of Magellanic
Irregulars and can dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal
from dwarf galaxies via the formation of extended tidal bridges and
tails. Such interactions are not only important for the evolution of
dwarf galaxies but also have direct consequences for the build-up of
baryons in our own MW, as LMC-mass systems are believed to be the
dominant building blocks of MW-type haloes.},

gas stripped out of the Magellanic Clouds and interacting with the
Galactic halo. In this first paper of an ongoing program to study the
Stream in absorption, we present a chemical abundance analysis based on
HST/COS and VLT/UVES spectra of four active galactic nuclei (RBS 144,
NGC 7714, PHL 2525, and HE 0056-3622) lying behind the MS. Two of these
sightlines yield good MS metallicity measurements: toward RBS 144 we
measure a low MS metallicity of [S/H] = [S II/H I] = -1.13
{\textpm} 0.16 while toward NGC 7714 we measure [O/H] = [O I/H I] =
-1.24 {\textpm} 0.20. Taken together with the published MS
metallicity toward NGC 7469, these measurements indicate a uniform
abundance of ?0.1 solar along the main body of the Stream. This
provides strong support to a scenario in which most of the Stream was
tidally stripped from the SMC ? 1.5-2.5 Gyr ago (a time at which the
SMC had a metallicity of ?0.1 solar), as predicted by several N-body
simulations. However, in Paper II of this series, we report a much
higher metallicity (S/H = 0.5 solar) in the inner Stream toward Fairall
9, a direction sampling a filament of the MS that Nidever et al. claim
can be traced kinematically to the Large Magellanic Cloud, not the Small
Magellanic Cloud. This shows that the bifurcation of the Stream is
evident in its metal enrichment, as well as its spatial extent and
kinematics. Finally we measure a similar low metallicity [O/H] = [O I/H
I] = -1.03 {\textpm} 0.18 in the v LSR = 150 km
s-1 cloud toward HE 0056-3622, which belongs to a
population of anomalous velocity clouds near the south Galactic pole.
This suggests these clouds are associated with the Stream or more
distant structures (possibly the Sculptor Group, which lies in this
direction at the same velocity), rather than tracing foreground Galactic
material.

For a sample of 157 pulsars at {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater}5{\textdegree} and 60{\textdegree} {\textless} l {\textless} 360{\textdegree}, located
in mainly interarm regions within about 3 kpc from the Sun, we find that: (1) The average volume filling factor along the line of sight /line\{f\}v and the mean density in ionized clouds
/line\{n\}c are inversely correlated:
/line\{f\}v(/line\{n\}c ) = (0.0184{\textpm} 0.0011)

/line\{f\}v {\textgreater} 0.01. This relationship is very tight. The inverse correlation of /line\{f\}v and /line\{n\}c causes the well-known constancy of the average electron density along the line of sight. As /line\{f\}v(z) increases with distance from the Galactic plane {\textbar}z{\textbar}, the average size of the ionized clouds increases with {\textbar}z{\textbar}. (2) For {\textbar}z{\textbar} {\textless} 0.9 kpc the local density in clouds nc (z) and local filling factor f(z) are inversely correlated because the local electron density ne (z) = f(z)
nc (z) is constant. We suggest that f(z) reaches a maximum value of {\textgreater}0.3 near {\textbar}z{\textbar} = 0.9 kpc, whereas nc (z) continues to decrease to higher {\textbar}z{\textbar}, thus causing the observed flattening in the distribution of dispersion measures perpendicular to the Galactic plane above this height. (3) For {\textbar}z{\textbar} {\textless} 0.9 kpc the local distributions nc (z), f(z) and ne2(z) have the same scale height which is in the range 250 {\textless} h ? 500 pc. (4) The
average degree of ionization of the warm atomic gas /line\{I\}w (z) increases towards higher {\textbar}z{\textbar} similarly to /line\{f\}v (z). Towards {\textbar}z{\textbar} = 1 kpc, /line\{f\}v (z) = 0.24{\textpm} 0.05 and
